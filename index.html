		<h1>Preparing for a successful freelance career.</h1>
		<p>
		According to the Bangladesh Governmentâ€™s ICT Division, there are well over 500,000 active freelancers currently residing in the country. In 2019, this made Bangladesh the country with the 8th largest number of freelancers globally.
        Although payment rate for freelancers from developing countries like Bangladesh is comparatively low, one can still earn up to USD 50 dollar or more from offshore freelance jobs with high level skills and experience.
        While freelancers work on a contractual basis with and for other organisations, they can avail offshore freelance jobs with required skills and experience. Many companies outsource certain services or parts of their production process to developing nations where they have a better bargain for their money. This low-cost labour opportunity, apart from the skilled group of individuals, is what gives countries like Bangladesh an edge when it comes to the freelancing market.
